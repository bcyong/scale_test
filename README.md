# Introduction

## Objective

The objective of this project is to programmatically perform quality checks on human labeled data for **ObserveSign**, a tech startup in the autonomous vehicle industry attempting to detect and understand traffic signals.

## Scope of Work

This project attempts to perform automated quality checks on already human labeled iamges according to specifications created by **ObserveSign**. To do this, the completed tasks are downloaded from Scale using the Scale API, as well as the associated original image being annotated, and a set of heuristics are applied to flag annotations that may contain errors or irregularites, which are then compiled into a JSON report.

# Codebase

## Files

This project consists of two files, `main.py` and `task.py`. 
`main.py` implements the actual quality checks performed on the Scale Tasks, as well as runtime logic to determine which project and tasks are evaluated.
`task.py` implements classes for Task and Annotation to organize data, as well as do some initial calculations used by the various quality checks.

## Dataflow

The data in this project proceeds as follows:
1. A set of completed tasks associated with a `project_name` are pulled down utilizing the Scale API
2. Data from each Task is used to create a Task object, with associated Annotations created as well
3. The source image related to the Task is pulled down
4. A set of quality checks are performed on each Task, both analyzing individual Annotations as well as the full set of Annotations for a Task
5. A JSON report is saved to disk listing Annotations for each Task that have been flagged with warnings or errors, along with the associated error messages

# Quality Checks Implemented

# Run Instructions 
Usage:

`> python main.py`

Full Usage:
```
> python main.py --help

usage: main.py [-h] [--project_name PROJECT_NAME] [--output_file OUTPUT_FILE] [--created_after CREATED_AFTER] [--created_before CREATED_BEFORE]`

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --project_name PROJECT_NAME
  --output_file OUTPUT_FILE
  --created_after CREATED_AFTER
  --created_before CREATED_BEFORE

The quality checks did not return any problematic annotations here. 

Upon visual inspection the annotations are pretty good. `information_sign` `d768` overlaps the bounding box for `b60b` and would benefit from a programmatic check of total overlap by other bounding boxes as opposed to the intersection over union check this project implements to ensure that either `d768` or `b60b` is marked at least partially occluded.

The quality checks identify 3 Annotations as too dim, and 1 Annotation as too bright, and marks them as warnings.

Upon visual inspection, it does appear that the majority of the Annotations are either too dim or too bright, enough so as to question if there should be Annotations there at all. `4d8c`, `5533`, and `802a` are all marked correctly marked as dim, and `da64` is correctly marked as too bright. `1000` is also probably too dim but the brightness exceeds that of the current threshold set for the quality check.

The quality checks did not return any problematic annotations here. 

Upon visual inspection the annotions seem solid. There is a glaring omission of 2 `policy_sign` in the right foreground and a less visible sign in the right background on a light pole from the annotations.
